# Jog2K I2C Jog Controller for GRBLHAL2000

These mechanicals are currently only set up for A5 and prior revisions.  They will not work well with the A6 slim PCBA.

This is the original enclosure for Jog2k, which can be printed completely via FDM/FFF. This version of the enclosure is simple to print, and provides all of the same core functionality as the Deluxe version, minus the labels. Buttons are printed in clear PETG.
